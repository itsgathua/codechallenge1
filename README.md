# GRADE GENERATOR

This is a simple program that determines a student's grade based on their marks. The input marks must be between 0 and 100, and the program outputs the corresponding grade according to the following criteria:

A: Marks greater than 79
B: Marks between 60 and 79
C: Marks between 50 and 59
D: Marks between 40 and 49
E: Marks 40 or below
If an invalid mark (outside the range of 0â€“100) is entered, an error message is displayed.

## HOW TO RUN CODE

### PREQUISITES

Ensure you have a JavaScript runtime environment installed, such as Node.js.

### STEPS

-Copy the code into a file
-Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the file.
-Run the program using Node.js using node file.js

### OUTPUT

-For the example input 77, the program outputs: B
-If an invalid mark is entered, the program outputs: Error! Please input a valid mark between 0 to 100

-Feel free to modify the studentGrade variable to test different inputs.



# SPEED DETECTOR

This is a simple JavaScript program that evaluates the speed of a car and provides feedback based on the following rules:

-If the speed is 70 km/h or below, the program outputs "Ok".
-If the speed is above 70 km/h, the program calculates demerit points for every 5 km/h above 70.
-If the demerit points are 12 or below, it outputs the number of points.
-If the demerit points exceed 12, it outputs "License suspended".

## HOW TO RUN CODE

-Copy the code into a JavaScript-enabled environment, such as a Node.js environment.
-Call the function by typing checkSpeed() and pressing Enter.
-Enter the car's speed (in km/h) when prompted.
-View the result in the console.

### Example Usage

-If the input speed is 65, the output will be:
Ok
-If the input speed is 80, the output will be:
Points: 2
-If the input speed is 140, the output will be:
License suspended



# SALARY CALCULATOR

This project calculates the **Net Salary** for an employee based on their basic salary and benefits. It takes input for basic salary and benefits, processes the information, and outputs the gross salary, deductions, and the final net salary.

## FEATURES

- **Gross Salary Calculation**: Adds basic salary and benefits.
- **PAYE Calculation**: Calculates the Pay As You Earn tax based on income brackets.
- **NHIF Deduction**: Calculates National Hospital Insurance Fund deductions based on salary.
- **NSSF Deduction**: Calculates National Social Security Fund contributions.
- **Net Salary**: Subtracts the deductions from the gross salary to give the final net salary.

## HOW TO RUN CODE

1. Copy the code into an HTML file and open it in a browser.  
2. The code will prompt the user to input their **basic salary** and **benefits**.  
3. The script will calculate the **gross salary**, **taxes**, **deductions**, and output the **net salary** in the browser console.

## Requirements

- A modern web browser (Google Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
- No additional dependencies are required.
